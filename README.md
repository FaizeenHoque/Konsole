Konsole built by FaixeN for Hack Club’s Blueprint Program. It features a mini console design with 8 push buttons, an oled screen and a on off switch.

## CAD Model

## PCB

This is the PCB for the small handheld console. It includes the buttons, display, Pico, and other parts all routed together on a compact board. The layout is designed to be easy to hold, simple to build, and portable enough to take anywhere. All traces are cleaned up and organized so the console works reliably and stays easy to update in the future.
